# Welcome!
I'm Annie, a Master of Urban and Regional Planning (MURP) student at UCLA. This is my repository for UP 221 - GIS and Spatial Data Science. This course aims to teach students like myself to critically analyze spatial data and create visualizations related to the field of urban planning.

# Project Ideas and Class Objectives
I'm interested in pursuing project ideas that relate to walkable neighborhoods, food access, and public transit. Through this course, I hope to familiarize myself with Python, learn how to create beautiful maps that communicate key insights __concisely__ and __effectively__, and ultimately create a final product that my whole group can be proud of.
